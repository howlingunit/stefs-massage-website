A tailor-made experience, allowing me to choose which aromatherapy oil she would use and which music she would play, as well as choosing the right pressure for me and which areas to focus on. The room was warm and massage bed, comfortable. I was even offered a drink and snack afterwards! Incredibly priced massages, well worth every penny! Highly recommended!', 'lauren-golledge.jpeg'),
  (1, 'Chloe Mathias', 'I recently had my 2nd massage from Stef this time around, having a full body massage. I spend a lot of time in the gym, so my muscles can get very tense, and I also do trampoline and gymnastics, which makes me very accident-prone, so I usually have some ache or pain somewhereðŸ˜† Stef makes each massage bespoke and wont hesitate to focus on a particular area if needed. This has been a lifesaver for me when Ive been in a lot of pain, and the massages have really helped relieve that. Stef is such a friendly and lovely lady and will always go out of her way to make you feel comfortable. I would recommend Stef if you need a massage!!', 'chloe-mathias.jpeg');
